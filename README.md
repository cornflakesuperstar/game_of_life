# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British 
mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970 - [Wikipedia] [1]

## Project inspiration
Pete Yandell hosted a [code retreat] [2] at Envato on August 27th in 2011 where we practised TDD pairing by using the Game of Life as our problem. It was a bit tricky to bang out a solution in 45 minutes. This github project was created to think about it a bit more.
